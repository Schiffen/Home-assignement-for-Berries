Example Transcript for Testing
So before we get started, I just wanted to talk about a couple of things So the sessions are typically gonna be about 45 to 50 minutes in here. For the next 6 weeks. We'll be meeting about once a week and we're talking about whatever you have in mind, and wanting to bring up for this session. One thing that I wanted to bring to your attention is that, obviously, everything will be kept confidential here. And then there are just a couple things that I wanted to point out. There might be a couple instances that I would have to break confidentiality And some of those things would include if there was a court order. Obviously, I would have to respect That's If I ever believed that you would wanna harm yourself or any other people, I might have to get someone else involved just to make sure that everyone stays safe. So Obviously. And then any suspected child or elder abuse that would have to be reported as well. But other than that, everything will be kept confidential. One thing is that I do have to record these sessions for video and audio, and far as educational purposes. I'm still, you know, working on my master's and things like that. Are you okay with having everything recorded Yep. That's fine. Okay. Excellent. And then also, I might have to talk with my supervisor about some of the things that we we talk about. Other than that, everything is confidential between us 2, and that's also just for supervision and educational purposes. Okay. Mhmm. Okay. Excellent. So I guess why don't we get started? What are some things that brought you in today? I'm just overwhelmed with work. I have a lot going on, and then I just school, so things have just been piling on together. So just really overwhelmed with everything going on and trying to balance Yeah. I can understand that. Where do you work right now? I work at Whole Health, as a case manager. So work in the community with clients. In the CS working with people as with schizophrenia, things like that. So So So you're working full time and going to school as well? Mhmm. Yeah. Full time. I'm going to school all the time. Okay. Kind of classes are you taking right now? I'm taking theories techniques, and ethics, all of the core classes. And how has that been going with the workload and everything like that for you? I've been managing so far stress You know, I feel like I wanna have time for my friends I have to cancel ladders. I know I'm gonna do homework feel like I don't have time for myself right now. Right. Just trying to figure out the balance between all of that. Mhmm. Yeah. I use know, I feel bad saying all sometimes, and I've always just wanted to do that and not upset anybody. So I just need to hang out with people, but a great knowledge Yeah. I can imagine it's hard to find time to keep the social life in there. And Mhmm. You mentioned not wanting to let people down and Yeah. And then my husband's been a little frustrated lately just you know, he says, like, I don't really talk him as much anymore because I just wanna come home and decompress. He works from home all day and doesn't talk to anybody. He I come home, and he just wants to chat, chat, chat, and I come home and I just wanna relax and decompress and that. So you said, just wanting to come home and relax a little bit and not having to worry about keeping up that conversation. Mhmm. Yeah. But I I just I don't want let that go because I don't wanna, like, ruin the relationship. Know, I'm so busy with school that I don't get I have that time. Right. Balance, I guess. I can see that. Yeah. I just I don't feel like I feel And and I wanna fix it, but how do I So you're kinda confused on where to devote your time Mhmm. For all of those things? Yeah. I don't like, I wanna have time for myself. But also give him that time and that letter of relationship out of the way. Friends, 12, What kind of things have you been doing lately as far as managing time and Well, I come I usually have time set aside. So I have Wednesdays
off, and then I usually use that day for homework. And then Fridays, I do part of my night doing homework and then I usually give myself Friday, and we use and Saturday for friends. Something is homework again. I I usually just set the time aside. Making sure that I'm finishing times before I go. Because if I go out and I don't have the homework done, then I'm just, like, give a little, like, I'm stressed out. Like, I should be home getting that done, and I feel guilty about it. Like, oh, I shouldn't be hanging up with friends or seeing my family. Mhmm. And has that system been kinda working? Has it not been working? I'm is my work I just I just still feeling overwhelmed. Like, I'm still feeling that stress. Like, wishing I had more time. I think Just I don't know. Just wanting more time, I guess. You know, I end up like, I don't see all my friends every week. I don't see my family as much, and really gave me a hard time about it and nobody really understands, like, that school and work is my priority right now. And it's just a lot of pressure from them to well, why don't you come in right now? So I'm almost feeling a little bit guilted and Having more of the social aspect versus placing more of an emphasis on school. Right. Right. Just because, like, none of them have gone in college. Like, they don't see the importance that I do. I don't know much as always. Well, why don't you go over? Like, why don't you spend time with us? I don't know. It was easier when I was an undergrad because I was in lacrosse. So Okay. I didn't have that pressure every weekend. Like, I went to school up there for that reason. Like, I 2 dismiss myself from people. So I was keeping my priorities straight, and now it's more of I to be more active about keeping blood priority straight. So it's been 12 being back here, being close to everybody, and just being close minded to directions. And you live pretty close to all your friends and family and everything like that by their Yeah. Yeah. About 30 minutes from everybody's they feel like I should be hanging out with them more because I am closer. I Whereas when I was in the cross, you know, I wasn't gonna drive 3 hours to see them. I mean, like, spilling pressure. Like, I had to be down and visiting us. But now it's more regular every week. It's Ebola, are you That's been hard. So to balance. Yeah. I can imagine just the pressure that they're constantly giving you every week would be kind of a lot to take on. Mhmm. Yeah. And especially because they got really see the parts that I do and that's been hard. So This will be good for me, and this is important to me. I do wanna see that, but I also would rather, like, keep my priorities and focus on school. Right. And I mix the No cross because do that, not feel guilty about it. Mhmm. It's kind of a little bit easier to create that barrier. Yeah. So The distance meeting No. It's like I feel like I have to come up with excuses when I really I suppose, I don't really need to. Like, I think that school will be better with my excuse, but I always come up with other things. So you feel like some of your friends might respect some of those other excuses versus school at the work? Yeah. Just because none of them are in school. Okay. So Yeah. It's with my family more solid on my friends. Like, don't really give it as much. So you get the same pressure with your family as well? Mhmm. Yeah. More so from them. Other day, my friend sent me flowers, which was really nice. She's late. I know what you don't attend anything out and then So And are you like, really busy as I get some flowers and my parents don't really do that. They're just more guilt trip and over to my house over and it's always me going to that. I'm Well, I have more shit to do than I. So how I guess, what are some of the ways that your parents kinda make you feel guilty Just asking why, and like all your got time for your friends. You'll go hang out with them, and I see you're hanging out with your sister on the weekends, but you don't come over there. Mostly my parents. And then I see my husband's parents a lot because they come over, like, they're always making an effort to come to our house so that we don't have
to travel out there and they see them, you know, with them. So it's just a lot for us to have to travel to you while I was Right. So you feel like it'd be maybe a little bit easier if they made more of an effort to come to you instead of the other way around? Mhmm. Yeah. I guess I don't know. I just, like, I don't know. It's it's maybe it's stubborn sometimes, but also, like, why I don't Why are you expecting something of me when you're versus receiving love? Right. So I can imagine that'd be difficult to try to find a good way to keep kind of everyone happy and keep your peace. Mhmm. Yeah. I just I just don't know what there is to do. Like, I really can't I can't call back on work. The money, and it is experience And then like, school, I I have this need to get done. Like, I wanna get done in I cutting back the classes, like, Any always tell myself that's not an option. I'm gonna power through your list. That You know, I worked you know, over 60 hours while in school, like, while I was in a undergrad, I was in school full time working I know I can manage it. So It's just being close to everybody. Like, I have friends on the cross I was able to stay no more often because it wasn't, like, the From I could not with had a really close connection to Okay. I feel like maintaining relationships here has been more important to me than the ones in Macross because there, I knew it was temporary. Like, I knew I was leaving it to I also know Then what those relationships I feel like you have to kinda keep that going and not obviously lose those connections. Mhmm. Yeah. And I just don't wanna upset them. Like, I don't wanna feel like they're not important. I don't. So it's more about the Right. Putting school first, but then not feeling that they're Okay. Seems like it's been pretty hard to figure that all out and from what we said before that you had done it previously Mhmm. Are you kinda feeling like oh, why can't I do this now? Yeah. Because you already done it before? Yeah. Exactly. Like, why am I not And I think about it, and I just you know, now my husband's kinda feeling that. I'm that way. I'm not giving him Yes. Confronted and I You know how it's everywhere. You can come from So the I think that's when has been impacting me the most and causing the most stresses. His feelings towards it and that's the last relationship I wanna have affected by. Right. And were you guys together when you were in your undergrad? I met him here, and then he went to school on La Crosse. So I would we were in your And then I moved up 20 has I mean, he has given me a hard time. Like, he always keep on taking on more and we need to stop and he didn't he didn't tends to be my voice and reason, but I don't I like to make my own decisions and you know, I listen, but I also chew coin and end up taking on more I just that's my work ethic. I just take on more with work and take on more with see what I am capable of. I think I just try and push myself more and more to see where my breathing point is this. Right. The way he sees it, I suppose. And And I think sometimes he's worried. Is that how you see it as well? Yeah. Sometimes, like, I I don't there's no intention get to the breaking point. I just like to push myself further and further. You're pushing yourself too far and I don't know. I think he is feeling that right now. So it's hard for me to see him. So what kind of things do you tend to take on extra? What do you mean by that? I would work a lot. I'm always trying to go above and beyond and get more experience with my last job at like, I loved that job, and I worked in my group home working with adults with disabilities. So, like, I just wanted to get more experience and I took on 2 of extra jobs on top of that. Uh-huh. One thing in the same company, but it was they were it was a way for me to get more experience into a and do a case management. Mhmm. And I mean, it it was a lot when I was in school, and but to me, it was worth it. Like, I if I didn't do that, then I wouldn't have the job that I have now. Because of that those 3 months of a lot of extra work and me coming home crying. Like, I got this job that I have now as a case manager, and I
don't know. I'm always pushing myself to take on extra stuff to get more experience. So now at the job I'm at now, I'm I'm hourly, so I can't do like, I don't give the opportunity to do extra stuff. So as a case manager, we they can do therapy groups, I, obviously, I can't do therapy. But I took her on a group and And is it just you said getting more experience? Yeah. Is that experience for your future career? Is that just experience for you? It's, like, personal experience. I knew something that I it's hard for me to speak publicly, and as much as I didn't wanna do it, I would like, I was just thinking that's like, oh, to a group. Like, because I know I need to push myself to do those so that I'm more comfortable and I hate it. Like, I go when you're nervous, but I know that It's valuable for me later as over time life. Be more comfortable with it. But it's adding a lot of time, and I'm taking homework And I'm not supposed to because I'm not really So I'm, like, working through free, not doing my own time home. So And how often is that crew? It's once a week, but I have to prepare the it's an hour long once a week. Alright. I'm also learning about the group. So it's an anger management group, and I don't have as much as I can't do therapy with them, but it is like a teaching class. So I'm gonna learn So the week before, and then I teach it So I teach what I've learned. So I'm also learning about anger management. Mhmm. On top of Julie and the group. So Right. And then kind of the struggle of working for free with that, it sounded like hard. Yeah. I don't know. I've always That's just how I was raised. I to push and push and work hard and I just like it's almost like my resume. Like, I just keep wanting to put more on it. And do you do you want to say no, or is it just you feel like you have to? Or I think it's, like now I wanna take it back and say, I can't do this anymore, but I can't do that either. There Okay. It's like I wanna do it but I just don't think about the time Oh, yeah. We'll do more. We'll do more because it's valuable experience with Right. So it sounds like a good idea at first. And then when you really get into it, it's where that struggle kinda comes from. Mhmm. Yeah. It's just the hard work. I look back and regret taking on extra things. But I've always done that. I've always like, throughout undergrad, I've had a no less than 3 jobs at the times. I don't know how I keep friends. And I think that's where I'm struggling now. It's like I wanna continue that same behavior because that's What? It has been value. That's, like, where I hold my values as that experience and always learning more and always pushing myself to those limits. And then I wanna maintain those relationships and stutter any I'm still working with kind of the same amount of time, essentially. Mhmm. I think I'm gonna cut back on you. It's So what would you say are some of the most important things for you? I hate to say it, but Marcus like my work and school is where I strive and that's where I hold the highest value? Or And sometimes I struggle with that because I don't hold my relationship highest point and I think some people would or some people would look down on me for them. Thinking that I don't value my friendships or my relationships as much as I do work and I think my husband knows that like, he he's okay with that. I think people can't really come to terms with that as much as he can. So it's always work school, Kind of in that order? Mhmm. I'd say so. But the thing is, like, my friendships and my relationships make me happier than my work at this point. I just still love my job, and I don't as much as I did It was just so the jobs that I had in Macross, I loved it was just the people I worked with. Working with people with disabilities was just so rewarding for me. It was like a family. So I managed to group homes. So it was, like, the same guys. And it was, like, going home to my family and, like, I don't know. They missed me when I left, and forward to me coming back, whereas now I'm dealing with crisis all the time and my client's just, like, have no interest in us being there and, like, they are voluntary, but it's more about know, pushing making sure they're,
you know, working towards change in their various ambivalent at this point. So it's, like, feeling that the clients don't want me there. Sometimes it's just harder, and what like, it it's rewarding. Mhmm. But it's not the same relationship that I have at the other job, and I just relationship with the clients Some of the relationships are good, and I've built relationship with relationships with clients now, but it's just very different. How do stress all the time. A lot of crises. People that they want your help but also don't want it. Whereas my clients before, they wanted you to go. They And So there might sound kinda sounded like it was more collaborative, a bit more supportive than you are now. Yeah. Yeah. Was it the same amount of stress? Level? Or No. I felt like going to work, but I didn't dread it. I it was just How do I go to work and then we just be another motion. It would be as much fun as I had at home. Now I just, like, dread coming to work. It's stressful. It's also So god, a lot of structure problems. So it's not the best environment for learning. It's valuable experience. So you kinda almost feel like you have to stay there for the experience? Mhmm. As much as I hate it, it's I'm learning so much about, like, the system of mental health. But the clients are just different. Like, if I could go back to her, if you I just know I don't have time to apply for jobs or even I'm just like, I'm gonna wait till it breaks. Apply for jobs. Because I don't see myself staying there long term. So it kinda seems like you feel a little bit stuck in where you are at right now you don't have the time to devote to applying Yeah. I mean, the thought of quitting has crossed my mind a lot and before it was what? Just started I can't quit yet. And 3 other people quit. I feel guilty about quitting and now I have a full team and I wouldn't feel as guilty quitting, but I'm also realizing how much I've learned there and So So it's kind of a struggle between what you wanna do and what you should do almost. Mhmm. Yeah. I hate quitting and disappointing people. Let you a team that I worked with for the last 6 So you feel like you'd be letting the company down? Letting your chin down? Yeah. 9. They aren't as invested in me there. Like, it's not as much of a family as I've also had my last job. Like, they're very resistant to new people coming in and they weren't really willing to teach So I don't know. It's just been hard, and I'm very self driven there, and it's not really like, we an acting event that's supposed to work as a team then. They they're just not like, the 2 people that had been there the longest was open to the team based It's been hard adjusting to that job, and I just always think that I always compare it to my last job, and I'm constantly doing that. And why did you I met your last job. Because I moved back here I'm moving back here after undergrad. So that was always a plan, and then I moved back and So it wasn't really a position that you wanted to quit? Yeah. I knew I wanted to move on from that position just because it I really had learned all I could learn there. But it was a company that I could've stayed with and moved out with And they were willing to give me positions, but they knew I was late then so that kinda stopped because about a year before I moved, So They had case management positions open and that's the field I wanna eventually go back to I've been wanting to do case management really bad, and So the physician was open, and they interviewed, and they really are you planning on staying with us? We know you wanna go to grads. And that was I probably would have had 6 months there in that position. So they said, wanted to lay that with you know, you don't want a case manager to quit after 6 months, but what makes sense in those I just I don't know. I just wish I could've And they they did offer me, like, a temporary position to fill in, but So I did get that experience. It just I wish I could have stayed there. Like, I wish the company Yeah. So it almost sounds like you felt like you could it was the right position for what you were looking for as far as you know, the team environment that's support, and then somewhere where you could
really grow. Mhmm. Yeah. You feel like you don't really have that with the company that you have now? Right. It's just very impersonal. It's not a company I could see myself working for long term. I wanted it to be, but They just have a lot of work to do and attitude that we had a lot of people quit. Since the time I started. Like, 5 case managers has started. Around the same time right after me have already have Because the attitude is just so negative. It's So, like, when I started, I was like, are you gonna come back tomorrow? And it's just so bad. And as Vince just said, for new people, like, what why wouldn't I come back? Is there a reason I shouldn't come back? Yeah. That just kinda carries on every day, this attitude of we all hate our jobs. And the stress sucks. So we hope you come back. It's That's good. That's a good attitude to have. And it's gotten better I kind of expressed my concerns about it. And I It's just taking a lot of time, but I just miss that family and close knit Claritin work then. I have at my master's. Right. Do you feel like your concerns are being heard or not really in the company? I think they're hearing it. It's just they don't know how to fix it. They have a few case managers, which is unusual for case managers. Have people there for that long. It's typically people come in for their supervision hours, and then they leave after 2 years. But there's a few that have been there, and they come set that attitude. Of So they don't know how to do an attitude check with them. And they're coming to me for advice I Why are you asking me on how much of It's They know I have supervisor experience and you're like, how would you make this more positive? I'm like, why can't change their attitude to my job to give you that advice. I feel like I don't feel right about it either. Like, lurking on my Do you have to feel like they should be handling it. Instead of, obviously, bringing the problem to you. Mhmm. Yeah. Like, I mean, for supervision, weekly, and a lot of my supervision time is And can we fix this TM, and what would you do? Let's see. I can give you that input, but it's not gonna try to fix feel like I don't know what's that mean to tell her everybody's thoughts. Right. I don't wanna be that person. I can tell her that attitude I'm feeling, but I don't wanna tell her, like, Let's And this person did this to make you feel that way and And does that kind of go into you know, making sure you keep people happy and Mhmm. Things like that. Yeah. It's always this constant need to come from from the side of the lock for me to even bring it up. I was considering quitting because of the attitude and Yeah. Imagine Yeah. How are Colby fits with people that have been here that long and if you want them to change, they're gonna leave, and you don't wanna lose your best So it could it's hard for them, but You're gonna feel like they couldn't they're not doing as much as they maybe could. Yeah. It's like there's no big fix. Like, I would want. Therapy appointment because it is stressful to come into that environment every day. It's draining. And then like, I know there's no quick fix, but I knew I wanted health. To not wanna come to work every day. Exhausting the being in that environment and then have to go home and do everything that you have to do. Mhmm. Yeah. And it sounds like you really don't quite a bit on your plate right now. Yeah. Yeah. And that's just how old do I I don't know. How do I find something to de stress and That's another added stress is that I am going through the rejection, you know, because that's inevitable when you're buying and that's just a lot. Just keep going, or do I find so It's just another thing that you've got on your flight. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm not I think that they just always do that's But you did say that that, you know, causes you obviously the taking on Yeah. So I'm just kinda learning and go right now because that's just not a good timing but I would just I'm always afraid of, like, reaching the brain last week, I had a really stressful day, and I I don't know. I, like, thought I was reaching the right knee point. It's, like, And then I just I remember, like, Keep going through the cycle I don't I need
to quit tomorrow. Like, I just not gonna go back. It was that bad, and stressful. And then the next day is, like, already, like, kinda, actually. What made that day so stressful? We had a client passed away, so that kinda started the day happy, and then I went to a client's house and she was attacked by your boyfriend and you know, I try all day to get her into other services and get her help get her out of the house bring her back to the office to see her doctor derma I'm waiting for her to see the doctor to come back, and I find out she left. I'm like, what like, why did you do that for? Like, I I moved my entire day around. It was seeing 3 clients at the same time just and then I tried to get her in. Around seeing other clients So I really was just, like, finding places at once and then She left. I was like, I feel completely helpless. Like, I tried everything I could Like, I did my part, and then to find out she's going back to her boyfriend. I it was just hard for me to take that. I can't help everybody. Like, I was kind of feeling almost that guilt that Yeah. Even though you did everything you could quite enough. Right. Yeah. It's just hard. Like, knowing that this is gonna be something that I'll have to deal with and seeing her was just like it was sad. Like, it was really sad to see her, and I was Probably, like, one of the balls difficult cases so far that I've had to deal with. Just knowing she has been through a lot of trauma and not being able to fix it for her. I believe we as in this field, like, we wanna help people and, like, do it like a panel of somebody even though you did everything you could and So that was hard. I just I can't go through this one. I'm trying to focus on school. So I came home and just, like, broke down I just, like, okay. Wonder why What would be, like, my list to you? I don't I'm working as a receptionist, do something. I don't wanna do So But in this sense, I'm doing that right now because my clients really tell me like it is. Alright. In reception. I was at a hospital. Some But, like, at the same time, I wanna be Nice And don't wanna minimize that because I don't feel like I'm wasting my time. So like, I'm always trying to challenge my This job is challenging, really challenging, and know if I can get through this, then I can handle a lot more later. To a job where I'm just a receptionist or something like that. Like, what good am I getting off of that? Ircise money. So it kinda almost sounds like you're trying to add a bunch on your plate just to see how much you really can't handle. Mhmm. Yeah. I'm guaranteeing that, hey. I can make you through. In the future. Is that Correct? No. So making sure that you know, I'm able to get a job later. Like, I'm always trying to build this so that I have security and jobs later, and I don't know. It just always comes down to that. I, like, want to always have a secure job and Is that something that's more easier for the future? Yeah. Sometimes. I always wanna make more. I always wanna do more and develop more. Like, I can't just have a job where I'm, like, at this So going with the motions every day. So I always wanna challenge myself. Later And did you wanna be a case manager? Once you get out, or is there something else that you're looking to do after school? Pierce management isn't my end goal. So I think case management experience is really hard and it helps people manage crisis, but, eventually, I wanna do counseling I mean, that's the end goal is Mhmm. Mostly, but also doing more with that, I guess. Okay. So I don't know. Like, I don't know that there's more out there. And trying to learn what what would fit for me because, like, I don't like, I know I wanna do counseling, but I wanna do more on top on top of that. Okay. I don't I don't know. I think that's what I wanna learn. Like, Great mouth is clearing what fits well and What job are you gonna do on top of? Like, in the future, I always plan to be doing 500 claims So So this is kind of a pattern that you always see yourself as doing. You mentioned before that you would always And So like that. Mhmm. So is that what you kinda thrive on Mhmm. I think so. I I feel proud of myself when I'm doing more and I'm challenging myself So So what happens
if you don't have that I I question my words, I think. To I question myself a lot. I have self doubts So I don't know. This was So I don't know. I don't I don't know. So Yeah. Because it seems like from what you've brought up, you know, you have placed such an emphasis on doing all this but at the same time, it's stressful. Mhmm. So it's kind of balanced we know that. Yeah. I guess I don't know what what I would be like if I had one job, like, one obligation wasn't challenging me. I don't think I'd be happy with I don't know. I think I get to be happy. I need the stress. Like, okay. Kind of a good amount of chaos. Almost. Yeah. Look. I I feel Like, I have more something when I'm doing all that. Like, but it's also to be like, hey. I took the sugary one. I found a random I need to validate from other people too, I think. Right. Oh, you did a lot. You worked hard. I don't know. I like hearing It's a good thing to hear from people. Yeah. I don't know. It's like think it's just, like, wanting to make them proud and Because, like, my dad was just he worked really hard, and like, he didn't go to college.
